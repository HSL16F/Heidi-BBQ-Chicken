        "doctor": "Good afternoon, Mrs. Thompson. How have you been feeling lately?",
        "patient": "I've been okay, doctor. Just a bit of back pain that won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now.",
        "doctor_response": "I see. Given the duration of your symptoms, I’d recommend a physical therapy assessment to help with your posture and strengthen the muscles around your spine. I’ll refer you to a specialist in musculoskeletal therapy. I’ll send the referral over today.",

        "doctor": "Mr. Harris, your recent blood pressure readings have been higher than usual. How have you been managing your diet and exercise?",
        "patient": "I haven’t been exercising as much as I should, and my diet’s been a bit on the heavier side recently.",
        "doctor_response": "In that case, I’d like to refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. It’s important to manage hypertension early to prevent any complications. I’ll get the referral over to the cardiology department, and they’ll contact you for an appointment.",

        "patient": "Yes, it’s been itching quite a bit, and the redness has gotten worse over the past few days.",
        "doctor_response": "It seems like it could be eczema or possibly an allergic reaction. I’m going to refer you to a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. I’ll send the referral to their office, and they should reach out to you soon.",

        "patient": "Yes, I've noticed it’s worse after eating dairy, especially milk and cheese.",
        "doctor_response": "This could be a sign of lactose intolerance, but I recommend we get a more comprehensive evaluation. I’ll refer you to a gastroenterologist for further testing. They may perform some tests to check for any underlying conditions.",
        "patient_response": "Thanks, doctor. I’ll follow up with the specialist."

        "patient": "It’s almost every night. I wake up multiple times, and it takes me a long time to fall back asleep.",
        "doctor_response": "This could be related to stress, or it might be a sleep disorder like insomnia. I’d like to refer you to a sleep specialist who can evaluate your sleep patterns and possibly conduct a sleep study if needed.",
        "patient_response": "That sounds helpful. Thank you, doctor."

        "doctor_response": "It could be a sign of osteoarthritis, but we’ll need a more detailed evaluation. I’m referring you to a rheumatologist, who specializes in joint and autoimmune conditions. They’ll be able to assess your symptoms more thoroughly.",
        "patient_response": "Thank you, doctor. I’ll make an appointment with them."
