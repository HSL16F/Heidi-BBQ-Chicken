Mr. Harris, your recent blood pressure readings have been higher than usual. How have you been managing your diet and exercise?
I haven’t been exercising as much as I should, and my diet’s been a bit on the heavier side recently.
In that case, I’d like to refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. It’s important to manage hypertension early to prevent any complications. I’ll get the referral over to the **Cardiology** department, and they’ll contact you for an appointment.
Okay, I understand. I’ll follow through with that. Thanks, doctor.
